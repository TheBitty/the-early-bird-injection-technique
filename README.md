# Early Bird APC Injection Research

A comprehensive study and implementation of the Early Bird APC (Asynchronous Procedure Call) injection technique, demonstrating advanced Windows internals concepts for security research and education.

## üìö Overview

This project explores the Early Bird injection technique, a process injection method that executes code before a process's main thread begins. The implementation includes:

- **Remote Payload Staging**: Downloads shellcode from a web server
- **Process Manipulation**: Creates suspended processes using Windows debugging APIs
- **Memory Management**: Demonstrates VirtualAllocEx and WriteProcessMemory
- **APC Queue Manipulation**: Shows how to queue code execution via APCs

## üîß Technical Components

### Core Features
- HTTP/HTTPS payload delivery system
- Custom wrapper functions for Windows APIs
- Server connectivity verification
- Dynamic memory allocation for variable-sized payloads
- Clean error handling and resource management

### Key Windows APIs Utilized
- `CreateProcess` with `DEBUG_PROCESS` flag
- `QueueUserAPC` for code execution
- `VirtualAllocEx` / `WriteProcessMemory` for injection
- WinINet APIs for network communication
- Winsock for server status verification

## üèóÔ∏è Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2019 or later
- Windows SDK
- Python 3.x (for payload server)

### Building
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `Stage & Early Bird Injection.sln` in Visual Studio
3. Build the solution (Ctrl+Shift+B) in Release mode
4. The executable will be in `x64/Release/`

### Setting Up the Payload Server
```bash
# Navigate to your payload directory
cd payload_server

# Start the HTTP server
python -m http.server 8000
```

## üíª Usage

### Basic Execution
```bash
# Start the payload server first
python -m http.server 8000

# Run the injection tool
EarlyBird.exe
```

### Understanding the Flow
1. The tool checks if the payload server is running
2. Downloads the payload from `http://localhost:8000/calc.bin`
3. Creates a suspended instance of the target process
4. Allocates memory and writes the payload
5. Queues an APC to the main thread
6. Resumes execution, triggering the payload

## üõ°Ô∏è Detection and Defense

Understanding offensive techniques enables better defensive strategies. Consider implementing:

- **Process Creation Monitoring**: Watch for `DEBUG_PROCESS` flag usage
- **APC Queue Inspection**: Monitor for suspicious APC entries
- **Memory Protection Changes**: Alert on RWX memory allocations
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Detect unusual parent-child process relationships

## üìñ Educational Value
