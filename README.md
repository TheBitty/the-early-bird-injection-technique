\# Early Bird APC Injection Research



A comprehensive study and implementation of the Early Bird APC (Asynchronous Procedure Call) injection technique, demonstrating advanced Windows internals concepts for security research and education.



\## üìö Overview



This project explores the Early Bird injection technique, a sophisticated process injection method that executes code before a process's main thread begins. The implementation includes:



\- \*\*Remote Payload Staging\*\*: Downloads shellcode from a web server

\- \*\*Process Manipulation\*\*: Creates suspended processes using Windows debugging APIs

\- \*\*Memory Management\*\*: Demonstrates VirtualAllocEx and WriteProcessMemory

\- \*\*APC Queue Manipulation\*\*: Shows how to queue code execution via APCs



\## üîß Technical Components



\### Core Features

\- HTTP/HTTPS payload delivery system

\- Custom wrapper functions for Windows APIs

\- Server connectivity verification

\- Dynamic memory allocation for variable-sized payloads

\- Clean error handling and resource management



\### Key Windows APIs Utilized

\- `CreateProcess` with `DEBUG\_PROCESS` flag

\- `QueueUserAPC` for code execution

\- `VirtualAllocEx` / `WriteProcessMemory` for injection

\- WinINet APIs for network communication

\- Winsock for server status verification

\## üèóÔ∏è Build Instructions



\### Prerequisites

\- Visual Studio 2019 or later

\- Windows SDK

\- Python 3.x (for payload server)



\### Understanding the Flow



The tool checks if the payload server is running

Downloads the payload from http://localhost:8000/calc.bin

Creates a suspended instance of the target process

Allocates memory and writes the payload

Queues an APC to the main thread

Resumes execution, triggering the payload



\### üõ°Ô∏è Detection and Defense

Understanding offensive techniques enables better defensive strategies. Consider implementing:



Process Creation Monitoring: Watch for DEBUG\_PROCESS flag usage

APC Queue Inspection: Monitor for suspicious APC entries

Memory Protection Changes: Alert on RWX memory allocations

Behavioral Analysis: Detect unusual parent-child process relationships
